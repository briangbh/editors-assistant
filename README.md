# Editor's Assistant

Let's use modern tools to improve collaboration with the Design team
and re-imagine the content editing process too.

## Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) is the modern, open-source standard 
for building [Design Systems](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/guide-to-design-systems/). Using Storybook as the foundation, we can build an
interactive, continously updated design system for Big Health. 

## Playroom

[Playroom](https://github.com/seek-oss/playroom) is an open-source editor for
working with [React JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) 
components. The [Playroom Add-On for Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/addons/storybook-addon-playroom) integrates the Playroom editor with Storybook. 
Together, these projects enable a new editing experience for Big Health's
clinical content. 

## Running

To run the project: 

```sh
$ npm run designer
```

Then, open a browser tab to:

```sh
http://localhost:6006
```
